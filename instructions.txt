                                            AI Personal Trainer

In this project I will be building an AI Trainer using OpenCV and Python. I will use the pose estimation to find the correct points and using these points I will get the desired angles. Then based on these angles I find many gestures including the number of biceps curls and push-ups repitations etc. I will write the code in a way that I will be able to find angles between any 3 points with just a single line of code.

For coder:-

Step-1: Opening Webcam

Step-2: Finding and drawing all the points on body

Step-3: Getting only desired point

Step-4: Finding Angle between three desired points

Step-5: Drawing some UI

Step-6: Converting it into Class

Step-7: Opening Webcame and making Object of this class in anther file 

Step-8: Resizing the dimensions of webcam

Step-9: Getting position of three desired points

Step-10: Finding angle

Step-11: Finding percentage 

Step-12: Making bar 

Step-13: Drawing Bar and current count

Step-14: Getting frame rate and Showing it on the frame

Step-15: Closing Webcame


For User:-  

The user must be at a distance from the webcam. Its left side should be visible in webcam.
